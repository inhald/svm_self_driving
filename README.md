# ROS2 Autonomous Navigation
A **ROS 2** package for real-time autonomous navigation using fused point cloud data from a **SLAMTEC RPLIDAR A2M8** and an **Intel RealSense D435** camera. The system constructs virtual **SVM-like barriers** around detected obstacles and steers the robot to follow a path parallel to these barriers, enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance.
