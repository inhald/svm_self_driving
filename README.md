# ROS2 Autonomous Navigation
A fully-functional autonomous driving system utilizing a data fusion pipeline to fuse point cloud measurements retrieved from SLAMTEK A2M8 RPLIDAR and Intel RealSense D435 camera. It uses an SVM-like virtual barrier to separate obstacles from the vehicle and steer the vehicle parallel to the barriers.
